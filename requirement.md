# Project Background

I am currently studying an Applied Machine Learning course, where I have learned topics including Naïve Bayes classifiers, regression and
regularization, logistic regression and performance evaluation, decision trees and ensemble learning, neural networks and deep learning, 
convolutional neural networks (CNNs), attention models and transformers, generative AI, and unsupervised learning.

It is not required to include all of the topics listed above; instead, the project will be implemented based on industry best practices.

# Project Guidance
Please consider the format below:

slide 1: your project title and name list of your team members
slide 2: What is the business problem? How is machine learning applied there? i.e., what is the contrast of using machine
learning and not using machine learning?
slide 3: How to formulate the machine learning solution to the business problem? What is X, what is Y, is it a regression problem,
a classification problem, or an unsupervised problem?
slide 4: What is the dataset? How many rows? How many columns? If you split your data into training and test, how do you split them? 
Are there some data pre-processing steps that you think are important?
slide 5: How are you going to test the performance of your model? Why do you choose these performance measures?
slide 6: proposal of machine learning approaches that you plan to use, e.g., logistic regression, decision trees, etc. You only need to
list the name of the models; skip the details.
If there are n members in your team, n = 4 or 5, your project should propose at least n – 1 different machine learning techniques.
Neatness, conciseness and clarity of the slides is preferred over 'beautiful-to-the-eyes-but-uninformative-to-the-mind'.

# Project Proposal
Global job Salary Prediction with AI skills and experience.
Please train the data using different models and compare the results across the models.
Please recommend some machine learning algorithms to train the data. 

## Target Users
Primary User:
- Job seekers
- Policymakers

Decision:
- Career planning
- Offer benchmarking

Problem:
- Not transparent salary structure
- Pay equity issue (gender/diversity gaps)

## Salary prediction
Input: years of experience, job_title, skills
Output: Salaries between different countries 

# About Dataset
The location of data is ./data.
The AI & Data Job Salaries and Skills Dataset 2024-2025 is synthetically prepared and provides a detailed, global overview of
job listings in artificial intelligence, data science, machine learning, and related fields. This dataset aggregates job 
postings from October 2024 to July 2025, capturing a wide spectrum of roles, required skills, compensation, and organizational
attributes across multiple countries and industries.

With over 15,000 entries, each record details the job title, salary (in USD and local currency), experience level, employment type, 
company location and size, remote work ratio, required technical skills, education and experience requirements, industry, posting and
application dates, job description length, benefits score, and company name. This rich dataset is designed for data scientists,
career analysts, HR professionals, and researchers interested in AI workforce trends, salary benchmarking, and skills demand analysis.
